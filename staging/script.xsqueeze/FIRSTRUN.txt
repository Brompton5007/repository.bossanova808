XSQUEEZE NEW VERSION CHANGELOG....

[B]What's new in this version:[/B]

* 0.8.1 - Touch screen support cleaned up, simple up/dn volume control added
          Sliders aren't working very well so far, so I have left them out

        - Restored previous exit behaviour (waits for artist slideshow to 
          cleanly exit - it's slow, but it prevents artist slideshow crashing
          xbmc, so that's unfortunately the better option!) 

* 0.8.0 - Now compatible with exclusive audio devices that the new AudioEngine in
          XBMC locks for exclusive use.  When XSqueeze starts, it suspends AE,
          then it resumes AE on exit.

***TOUCH SCREEN SUPPORT IS STILL VERY PRELIMINARY ***

If you need help, post on the forum thread AND [B]PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR FULL XBMC DEBUG LOG FILE![/B]

[B]Now hit exit and re-run XSqueeze - you won't get this message again[/B]
