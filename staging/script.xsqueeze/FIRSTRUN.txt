OK SO SINCE THIS IF YOUR FIRST RUN OF THIS VERSION.... 


[B]XSqueeze addon settings have changed significantly![/B]

I strongly suggest you double check all your XSqueeze addon settings, and make sure you click 'ok' at the bottom (and NOT exit/back!) once all the settings are as you want, so that your new settings are properly re-saved over the old ones.

If XSqueeze does not start succesfully, try it again as some old settings sometimes seem to be cached, and check your log file for error messages!

If you need help, post on the forum thread AND INCLUDE YOUR LOG FILE!
