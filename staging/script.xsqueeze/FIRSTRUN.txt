XSQUEEZE NEW VERSION CHANGELOG....

[B]What's new in this version:[/B]

* 0.9.0  Improved Spotify browsing support (you must use squeezelite as your 
*          player for Spotify support, and have a Spotify account, and have 
*           Triode's third party Spotify Plugin installed! See Wiki!)
*        Updated Squeezelite to 1l.0RC2   
*        
* 0.8.9  Separate settings for player arguments for the two types of players
*          RENCONFIGURE your extra player arguments if you use these!
*          (You can now save arguments for both players if you switch between
*          them, save re-typing!)
*        Added configurable pause at startup to workaround gui sounds wierdness
*        Added setting for configurable pause for slow systems/networks - pauses
*          after creating the player so that it has time to connect

* 0.8.8  BIG CHANGES - SQUEEZELITE SUPPORT!
*
* ***** YOU MUST (ONCE)
*       RECONFIGURE XSQUEEZE
*       BEFORE RUNNING ANY VERSION POST 0.8.2!!!
*       IDEALLY, DELETE YOUR SETTINGS FILE in userdata/addon_data FIRST
*
* Integration of new squeezelite headless player (allows for high def audio, spotify etc)
* Expanded mouse/touch controls - use these if you choose squeezelite as your player
* (as squeezelite is headless and offers no display/controller)
*
* Removed auto detection of server/audio outputs - better to do this just
* manually, it's less error prone anway.
*
* Simplified the configuration fields
*
* Startup is quicker
*
