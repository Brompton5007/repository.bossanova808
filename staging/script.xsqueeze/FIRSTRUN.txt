XSQUEEZE NEW VERSION CHANGELOG....

[B]What's new in this version:[/B]

* 0.8.5  BIG CHANGES
* 
* ***** YOU MUST RECONFIGURE XSQUEEZE BEFORE RUNNING!!!
* 
* IDEALLY, DELETE YOUR SETTINGS FILE in userdata/addon_data FIRST
* 
* Integration of new squeezelite headless player (allows for high def audio, spotify etc)
* Expanded mouse/touch controls - use these if you choose squeezelite as your player
* (as squeezelite is headless and offers no display/controller)
* 
* Removed auto detection of server/audio outputs - better to do this just
* manually, it's less error prone anway.
* 
* Simplified the configuration fields
* 
* Startup is quicker

If you need help, post on the forum thread AND [B]PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR FULL XBMC DEBUG LOG FILE![/B]

[B]Now hit exit and re-run XSqueeze - you won't get this message again[/B]
