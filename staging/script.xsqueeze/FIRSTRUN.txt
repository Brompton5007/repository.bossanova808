XSQUEEZE NEW VERSION CHANGELOG....

[B]What's new in this version:[/B]

[B]* 0.5 was a MAJOR new release - NOW WITH EASY MUSIC CHOOSER! *[/B]

* In XSqueeze, hit 'i' or info on your remote to start the new easy music chooser...

* 0.5.4 Now opens the addon settings if you haven't configured an LMS server
* 0.5.3 Audio output chooser in settings should work again
* 0.5.2 Adds support for favourites, genres, years, radios, and limited app support
* 0.5.1 You can choose new music, albums, artists, random etc

* (The new Chooser generates quite a few spurious log messages due to a bug in XBMC...sorry about that!)

If you need help, post on the forum thread AND [B]PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR FULL XBMC DEBUG LOG FILE![/B]

[B]Now you can re-run XSqueeze - you won't get this message again[/B]
