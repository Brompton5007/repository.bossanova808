XSQUEEZE NEW VERSION CHANGELOG....

[B]What's new in this version:[/B]

* 0.6.2 New custom keymap system means no more annoying xbmc popups when changing tracks or volume
* (NOTE if XSqueeze crashes then you have to re-start and re-exit XSqueeze to tidy up the XSqueeze keymap)
* 0.5.8 - Preliminary ARM support - only tested with Raspbmc so far

If you need help, post on the forum thread AND [B]PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR FULL XBMC DEBUG LOG FILE![/B]

[B]Now hit exit and re-run XSqueeze - you won't get this message again[/B]
