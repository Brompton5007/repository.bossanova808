OK SO SINCE THIS IF YOUR FIRST RUN OF THIS VERSION....

[B]What's new in this version:[/B]

[B]* MAJOR NEW VERSION - NOW WITH EASY MUSIC CHOOSER! *[/B]
* In XSqueeze, hit 'i' or info on your remote to start the new chooser...
* You can choose new music, albums, artists, random etc
* Apps/Radios not implemented yet...

* New setting to resume playback immediately on startup (default: on)
