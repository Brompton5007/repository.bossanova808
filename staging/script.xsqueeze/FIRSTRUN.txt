XSQUEEZE NEW VERSION CHANGELOG....

[B]What's new in this version:[/B]

* Updated squeezelite to 1.6.3
* Trapped some dodgy unicode chars that caused crashes
* Moved various settings to a troubleshooting section that
  most people should not need to touch
* Give artist slideshow 4 seconds (by default) to exit cleanly, otherwise exit anyway
* ...as latest AS seems buggy in this area.

[B] STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU QUICKLY RE-CONFIGURE XSQUEEZE USING THE NEW SETTINGS [/B]

If you need help, post on the forum thread AND [B]PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR FULL XBMC DEBUG LOG FILE![/B]

[B]Now hit exit and re-run XSqueeze - you won't get this message again[/B]
