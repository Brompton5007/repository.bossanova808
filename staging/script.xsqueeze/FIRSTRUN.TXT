OK SO SINCE THIS IF YOUR FIRST RUN OF THIS VERSION....

[COLOR red][B]NOTE: XSqueeze addon settings have (again) changed significantly with V0.4![/B][/COLOR]

* Most are the same but if you have used the audio output chooser, please return to settings and run this again as I have found a bug in the way XBMC handles settings and worked around it with a new, simpler approach
* Make sure you click 'ok' at the bottom (and NOT exit/back!) once all the settings are as you want, so that your new settings are properly re-saved over the old ones.
* A solution has been found for audio droputs on Openelec (thanks HKShia!) - add '-y200' as an extra argument in the addon settings and they should go away.


What's new in this version:
* New info rich UI (Confluence)
* A lot of fixes at the unicode/character level - for example, search now works...
* Much more efficient internally and puts a lot less load on your server, only pulling larger chunks of data when a change event is detected
* (Well on our way for use of script.artistslideshow with this...coming soon!)
* Player state icon support (play, pause, or stop)
* Support for more details of the current track + basics of the next 9 more...
* Cleaner GUI when playing radio streams.

If you need help, post on the forum thread AND [B]PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR FULL XBMC LOG FILE![/B]

[B]Now you can re-run XSqueeze - you won't get this message again[/B]
