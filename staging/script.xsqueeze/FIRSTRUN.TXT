OK SO SINCE THIS IF YOUR FIRST RUN OF THIS VERSION.... 

HERE'S A REMINDER:

[B]1. IF ON LINUX/OSX/OPENELEC[/B], you MUST chmod +x the squeezeslave binaries or you won't get very far.  

Squeezeslave is used for server discovery, audio output discover, and of course playback.   

[B]2. ISSUES?? READ THE README.txt in the addon directory[/B] 

There's lots of useful stuff in there.  

Also, try manually running the squeezeslave binary in the add on folder to make sure you can get a connection and play audio.
