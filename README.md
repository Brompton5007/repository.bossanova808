Bossanova808 repository for xbmc.

Main offering is XSqueeze, a squeezebox player/controller for Kodi.  

Also, there is a script for displaying some now playing information on an external usb Yocto MaxiDisplay.

There are also some skin mods for personal use, and a minimal example script and plugin for testing purposes.
